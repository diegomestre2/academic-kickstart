Diego Tomé is a PhD. Student of database architectures at Centrum Wiskunde Informatica. His research interests include data compression, co-processing with GPUs and emergin hardware. He is part of the Database Architectures group from CWI, which  is well known as a top data systems research group, active in the broad area of data (management) systems and infrastructure for supporting data science.

The Database Architectures research group has a strong international reputation in academia and industry for pioneering column store technology, fast compression methods, vectorized query execution, on-line query-driven indexing (cracking), adaptive caching, and integration of statistical languages and analysis in database management systems.
